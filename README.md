## API Reference


A progressive web application for managing sales leads built using Ionic, Angular 2, and Typescript. This tool requires a configuration object that assists with pointing leads to the correct places.  Leads are able to be edited or deleted from the list view and are managed using SqlStorage.  The settings tab allows for marking all leads as new (on/off) and setting static fields to accompany each lead.  Leads will then periodically be pushed to an API endpoint for storage/collaboration in the cloud.
